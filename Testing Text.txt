### Depressed
Hello guys, I’m 21 with high eye pressure and currently on Lumigan. I recently got a few physical conditions, probably partly because of my mental disorders (doctors say mental health affects parts of our body — I have depression, anxiety, and OCD). My doctor wanted to prescribe me Cybralex, but I know these drugs can trigger glaucoma. Has anyone taken psychological pills without worsening eye pressure? Having mental illness and glaucoma is hard.

### Depressed
I’ve been with my boyfriend for 5 months. He already told me he was depressed. This week, I can feel he’s bothered. He doesn’t ask to sleep together or do things. I know I’m not the problem, but I just want to ask — how can I be there without suffocating him? I’m really clingy (which he usually loves), but now I feel like I’m doing too much. Any suggestions?

### Depressed
Been stuck in a loop of ruminating and overthinking. I still cannot seem to connect with someone I find attractive. I’m overwhelmed with what’s ahead and trying to stay calm, but imposter syndrome is ringing in my ears.

### Depressed
To me, it’s all I think about — what I lost. It’s just a matter of when and how at this point. I’ve never felt I wanted to do it this much before.

### Depressed
I feel like I’m at the end. Nothing I do is right. I feel stupid and worthless. I don’t see the point in living anymore. I don’t know if I can keep going...

### Depressed
I’m not excited, I’m not happy for him — I just want this day to be over. My brother is getting married today, and I feel absolutely nothing.

### Not Depressed
I recently went through a breakup. She said she still wants to be friends, and I said I’d try. But when she talks to me, it hurts. I just want to lose feelings so this pain stops. I don’t want to hurt her because she doesn’t want to lose contact, but I’m stuck. She hurt me while we were together, and I still love her. I wish we never met. How do I lose feelings?

### Not Depressed
I’ve been severely bullied since I was 5 till 15, which left me a depressed misanthrope with PTSD and anxiety. I’m now 18, have no friends or social contact. My studies will be online. I’m not into parties, bars, or dating sites. I do love my family, but I’m so lonely. Can anyone suggest activities to meet people? I don’t have hobbies besides obsessing about war and its causes. How long do I wait for the "better" days?
